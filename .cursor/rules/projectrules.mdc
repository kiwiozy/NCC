# WalkEasy Nexus - Project Rules

## CRITICAL: Protected Files (NEVER modify without explicit permission)

### Backend Protected Files:
- `backend/gmail_integration/services.py` - Production ready, working OAuth & email
- `backend/gmail_integration/models.py` - Database schema, critical
- `backend/gmail_integration/views.py` - API endpoints, critical
- `backend/xero_integration/services.py` - Production ready, working OAuth & sync
- `backend/xero_integration/models.py` - Database schema, critical
- `backend/xero_integration/views.py` - API endpoints, critical
- `backend/sms_integration/services.py` - Production ready, working SMS sending
- `backend/sms_integration/models.py` - Database schema, critical
- `backend/sms_integration/views.py` - API endpoints, critical
- `backend/documents/services.py` - Production ready, working S3 storage
- `backend/documents/models.py` - Database schema, critical
- `backend/documents/views.py` - API endpoints, critical
- `backend/ai_services/services.py` - Production ready, working OpenAI integration
- `backend/ai_services/pdf_generator.py` - PDF generation, critical
- `backend/ai_services/at_report_email.py` - AT Report emailing, critical
- `backend/patients/models.py` - Core data model, critical
- `backend/appointments/models.py` - Core data model, critical
- `backend/clinicians/models.py` - Core data model, critical
- `backend/ncc_api/settings.py` - Django configuration (temporarily unprotected for architecture development)
- `backend/ncc_api/urls.py` - URL routing (temporarily unprotected for architecture development)

### Frontend Protected Files:
- `frontend/app/components/settings/GmailIntegration.tsx` - Working integration
- `frontend/app/components/settings/XeroIntegration.tsx` - Working integration
- `frontend/app/components/settings/SMSIntegration.tsx` - Working integration
- `frontend/app/components/settings/S3Integration.tsx` - Working integration
- `frontend/app/components/settings/ATReport.tsx` - Working integration
- `frontend/app/components/Navigation.tsx` - Core navigation component
- `frontend/app/components/ClinicCalendar.tsx` - Working calendar component
- `frontend/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout, critical
- `frontend/next.config.js` - Next.js configuration, critical

## Rules for Code Changes:

1. **ALWAYS use file paths** - Never say "the email component", always say `frontend/app/components/settings/GmailIntegration.tsx`

2. **ALWAYS specify what NOT to modify** - If modifying a file, explicitly list protected files that should NOT be touched

3. **ALWAYS create new files for new features** - Don't modify existing working files unless absolutely necessary

4. **ALWAYS check .cursorignore** - Files listed there are protected and should not be modified

5. **ALWAYS be specific** - Instead of "fix the email system", say "fix the button styling on line 145 of GmailIntegration.tsx"

6. **ALWAYS suggest Git branches** - Remind user to create a branch before making changes: `git checkout -b feature/description`

7. **NEVER modify multiple protected files at once** - One protected file at a time, with explicit permission

8. **NEVER make sweeping changes** - If asked to "update all integrations", suggest doing them one at a time

9. **NEVER modify core models** (`patients/models.py`, `appointments/models.py`, `clinicians/models.py`) without explicit permission

10. **ALWAYS suggest testing** - Before modifying any protected file, suggest testing current functionality first

11. **ALWAYS ask for clarification** - If request is vague, ask for specific file path and line numbers

12. **ALWAYS warn before modifying protected files** - If user asks to modify a protected file, warn them and suggest testing first

## Code Organization:

- New features go in new files/directories
- Keep features isolated in separate directories
- Use feature flags for experimental features
- Document all changes in CHANGELOG.md
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

## Testing Requirements:

- Before modifying protected files: test current functionality
- After modifications: run tests and manual verification
- Integration changes: test end-to-end flow
- Database changes: test migrations and data integrity
- API changes: test all affected endpoints

## Git Workflow:

- Always work on feature branches (`git checkout -b feature/name`)
- Never push directly to main
- Commit frequently with clear messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`)
- Review changes with `git diff` before committing
- Test before merging to main

## Integration Protection:

The following integrations are **PRODUCTION READY** and **WORKING**:
- ✅ Gmail Integration (OAuth2, email sending, multi-account)
- ✅ Xero Integration (OAuth2, contact sync, invoice creation)
- ✅ SMS Integration (SMS Broadcast API, message sending)
- ✅ S3 Integration (document storage, file upload/download)
- ✅ AI Services (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, PDF extraction, clinical notes)

**DO NOT modify these without:**
1. Explicit user permission
2. Testing current functionality
3. Creating a Git branch
4. Reviewing related files
5. Testing after changes

## Response Patterns:

- **Vague requests** → Ask for specific file path and line numbers
- **Protected file modification** → Warn and suggest testing first
- **Multiple file changes** → Suggest doing one at a time
- **New features** → Suggest creating new files/directories
- **Refactoring** → Suggest feature flags and gradual rollout

## Code Quality Standards:

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use TypeScript for frontend (strict type safety)
- Use Django conventions for backend
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation when making changes
- Maintain consistent code style
- Write meaningful commit messages

## Safety Reminders:

When user asks to modify code:
1. Check if file is in protected list → Warn if protected
2. Suggest Git branch → Remind to create branch first
3. Ask for specificity → If vague, ask for file path and line numbers
4. Suggest testing → Remind to test before and after changes
5. Offer alternatives → Suggest creating new files instead of modifying existing

**Remember:** Safety first! Protect working code at all costs. When in doubt, create a new file or branch first.

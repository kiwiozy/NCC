# Walk Easy Pedorthics – Complete Letterhead / PDF / Editor Integration

This bundle contains EVERYTHING we discussed:

- Shared A4 letterhead CSS (safe zones)
- Next.js TipTap editor page with live letterhead preview
- Next.js API route to generate PDF via Puppeteer
- Django + DRF models/serializers/views to store letters
- Django endpoint that proxies to Next.js PDF service
- Designer export guide (from .ai → PNG/PDF)

You can drop this straight into your monorepo and move files to their real locations.

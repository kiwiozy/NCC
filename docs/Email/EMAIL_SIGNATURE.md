## 🔧 Implementation

### Automatic Signature Appending

The signature is automatically appended to all emails sent via the Gmail API integration.

**Implementation in `gmail_integration/services.py`:**

```python
def _load_email_signature(self) -> str:
    """Load the email signature HTML template"""
    signature_path = os.path.join(
        os.path.dirname(__file__),
        'email_signature.html'
    )
    with open(signature_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        return f.read()

def _append_signature_to_body(self, body_html: str) -> str:
    """Append email signature to HTML body"""
    signature = self._load_email_signature()
    
    # If body is a complete HTML document, insert before </body>
    if '</body>' in body_html.lower():
        return body_html.replace('</body>', f'{signature}</body>')
    
    # Otherwise, just append
    return f"{body_html}\n\n{signature}"

def send_email(self, ...):
    """Send email with automatic signature appending"""
    body_html_with_signature = self._append_signature_to_body(body_html)
    # ... rest of email sending logic
```

    <strong>Walk Easy Pedorthics</strong><br>
    Phone: 02 6766 3153<br>

    Web: <a href="http://www.walkeasy.com.au">www.walkeasy.com.au</a>

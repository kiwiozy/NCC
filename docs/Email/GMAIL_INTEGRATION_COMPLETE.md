## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "redirect_uri_mismatch"

**Solution**: Verify redirect URI in Google Cloud Console matches exactly:
```
http://localhost:8000/gmail/oauth/callback/
```
Include the trailing slash!

### Issue: Connection succeeds but shows "Not Connected"

**Solution**: Restart Django server to reload environment variables:
```bash
pkill -f "python manage.py runserver"
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && python manage.py runserver 8000
```

### Issue: Token expired

**Solution**: Click "Refresh Token" button or it will auto-refresh on next send

### Issue: "Error 400: invalid_grant"

**Solution**: Disconnect and reconnect your Gmail account

### Issue: Emails not appearing in correct Gmail Sent folder

**Solution (v2.0+)**: With multi-account support, emails appear in the Sent folder of the account you **selected when sending**. Use the "Send Using Account" dropdown to choose which account's Sent folder the email should appear in.

**Old behavior (v1.x)**: Emails appeared in the primary connected account's Sent folder regardless of "From" address.

### Issue: PDF attachment not included in email

**Solution**: This was fixed in v1.0.1. Make sure you're running the latest version with proper MIME structure (MIMEMultipart('mixed') for attachments)

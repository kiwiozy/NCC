## 🌐 Your Permanent SMS Webhook URL

```
https://ignacio-interposable-uniformly.ngrok-free.dev/api/sms/webhook/inbound/
```

**This URL will NEVER change!** ✅

Configure this in SMS Broadcast:
1. Go to SMS Broadcast dashboard
2. Settings → Webhooks
3. Set URL to the above
4. Enable for: Inbound messages + Delivery reports

---

## 🎯 How to Use (Daily Workflow)

### Morning - Start Work
```bash
./start-dev.sh
```
Wait 30 seconds, then open https://localhost:3000 (accept certificate warning)

**⚠️ HTTPS Required:** The app uses self-signed certificates for local HTTPS (required for OAuth, SMS webhooks). Your browser will show a certificate warning - this is normal! Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost"

### During Day - Check Status
```bash
./status-dev.sh
```

### If Something Breaks - Restart
```bash
./restart-dev.sh
```

### Evening - Stop Work
Just press **Ctrl+C** in the start-dev.sh terminal

## 🎉 **Features Update** (November 2025)

### ✅ SMS Notification Widget
The app now has **real-time SMS notifications** everywhere! No more missing patient messages.

### ✅ Console Filter
**Clean development console!** Grammarly errors and source map 404s are now automatically suppressed. You'll see `🔇 Console Filter Active` in your console.

### ❌ MMS Deferred
**Outbound MMS** (sending images to patients) has been **intentionally not implemented**. 
- **Reason:** Feature "hardly used" - not worth the cost ($6,192-$12,924/year)
- **What works:** SMS send/receive, inbound MMS (patients can send you images)
- **What doesn't:** Clinic can't send images to patients
- **Research:** All MMS research preserved in `docs/research/` for future reference

**Features:**
- 🔵 **Blue badge** on Dashboard nav - shows unread SMS count
- 🔔 **Dual notifications** - browser desktop + in-app toast alerts
- 📱 **iPhone-like widget** - see recent messages with 2-line preview
- 🎯 **Click to navigate** - tap any message to open patient's SMS dialog
- ✅ **Mark as read** - confirmation dialog when closing SMS conversation
- 🌐 **Global monitoring** - get notified even when not on Dashboard

**How It Works:**
1. Patient sends SMS → Arrives via webhook
2. App polls for new messages every 5 seconds
3. You see: Desktop notification + Toast + Badge update
4. Click notification → Navigate to patient + SMS dialog opens
5. Close dialog → Choose to mark messages as read

**Technical Details:**
- Polling interval: 5 seconds (low bandwidth, ~5MB/day)
- Endpoints: `/api/sms/unread-count/` and `/api/sms/inbound/<uuid>/`
- Event-driven: Uses custom events for real-time UI updates
- Desktop notifications: Requires browser permission (one-time prompt)

## 🎓 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Check Status First
Before starting, check if something is already running:
```bash
./status-dev.sh
./start-dev.sh  # Only if nothing is running
```

### Tip 2: View Live Logs
Keep a separate terminal open with logs:
```bash
tail -f logs/django.log
```

### Tip 3: Quick Restart
Something acting weird? Just restart:
```bash
./restart-dev.sh
```

### Tip 4: Background Mode (Optional)
If you want to run in background:
```bash
nohup ./start-dev.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &
./status-dev.sh  # Check it started
./stop-dev.sh    # Stop when done
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Port already in use"
The script handles this automatically, but if you see errors:
```bash
./stop-dev.sh
./start-dev.sh
```

### "ngrok not configured"
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN
```

### "Service not responding"
Check the logs:
```bash
tail -50 logs/django.log
tail -50 logs/nextjs.log
```

### Complete reset
```bash
./stop-dev.sh
pkill -f "manage.py"
pkill -f "next dev"
pkill -f "ngrok"
./start-dev.sh
```
